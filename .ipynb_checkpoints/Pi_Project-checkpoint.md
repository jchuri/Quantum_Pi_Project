# Pi Calculation Project

The motiviaton of this project is to show several ways in which pi can be obtained via a quantum computer. However, the underlying algorithms do not need to be quantum in nature the algorithms must include at least one significant quantum component. For this project I will show three ways of calculating by though there are many more and the process that I use to in each section may be suboptimal. 

The three versions are as follows: 
- [Monte Carlo method using Hadamard gates as a qRNG](./Hadamard_pi.ipynb)
- [Using the pulse mode in Qiskit to obtain estimate pi](./Pulse.ipynb)
- [Using Phase approximation algorithm](./Phase_estimation.ipynb)
